We stop ransomware and account takeover attacks in their tracks and dramatically improve the user experience. Beyond Identity\u2019s state-of-the-art platform eliminates passwords and other phishable factors, enabling organizations to confidently validate users\u2019 identities. The solution ensures users log in from authorized devices, and that the device meets the security policy requirements during login and continuously after that. Our revolutionary approach empowers zero trust by cryptographically binding the user\u2019s identity to their device and analyzing hundreds of risk signals on an ongoing basis. The company\u2019s advanced risk policy engine enables organizations to implement foundationally secure authentication and utilize risk signals for protection, rather than just for detection and response. For more information on why Intuit, Snowflake, and Roblox use Beyond Identity, please visit www.beyondidentity.com. Setup \u00b6 The Beyond Identity connector in PingOne DaVinci will perform an OIDC redirect to the Beyond Identity service for passwordless authentication and redirect back to PingOne DaVinci to continue the authentication flow.

Setup \u00b6 Before setting up the connector \u00b6 Please visit https://console.gocircle.ai/ to register the application. Click on the [Add New] and fill in the fields. Here we used Circle Ping Demo as an example: To get the Login Return URL , follow the steps: click on Connections ( left menu ) on the Ping Identity page. click on the [ New Connection ] button and add the Circle Access Connector click on the conector and the Redirect URL will be shown Using the connector in a flow \u00b6 After adding the connector to the flow, some fields need to be configured. Click on the connector to configure these fields: We have to go back to https://console.gocircle.ai/ to get the field values (click on the App info icon - the first icon) Use cases \u00b6 A common use case is to enable credential-free authentication for your current end users. This allows your end users to access your Web application and/or server from any public (or private) computer and browser while eliminating any possibility of the user's credentials being stolen or hijacked. The user authenticates by scanning a QR code on their smartphone, with no need to type in any information. Another popular use case is to enable easy and fast log-in for users that are already registered. In this case, the user has registered their email with you, so you just need to get the hash of your current user and compare it with the hashes returned from the Circle Access connector. For new users, Circle Access allows rapid and secure sign-ups, as the hash of the email is always available after the QrCode scan. This means that you can just request the email once and use the login scan to confirm it, without the need to send information or requests to the user's email. Once confirmed, you just save the information and let the user in. This method is secure on any public (or private) computer and browser because - even if the computer is compromised - the only information that is exposed is the user email, while the hashes and session information are delivered securely and directly to your connector.
